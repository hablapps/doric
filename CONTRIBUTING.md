# Contributing to doric

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! ðŸŽŠ

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow
from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/hablapps/doric/issues).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/hablapps/doric/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues)
to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone.
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Code contribution

Please, follow the official [Scala style guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/).
We also use `scalafmt` to check and format scala code, so you could use
any of the following commands to help you:

```bash
scalafmtCheckAll # Simply checks the code and reports style errors
scalafmtAll      # Checks the code and reformats everything that needs formatting
```

#### Fork

If you want to contribute solving issues or adding some features, the first thing
you should do is to fork the repository.

Your fork repository will copy the current [doric GitHub Actions](https://github.com/hablapps/doric/actions),
so you may want to keep it synced and use some of them.

#### Commits

Whenever possible, please follow the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification

#### Pull Request

- Even if you haven't finished your contribution, 
we encourage you to push your code and create a PR as a
[draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests)
so everybody knows it is a working in progress
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The doric team thanks you âœ¨.

We use the squash method while merging, so you will only see just one commit for your contribution.
